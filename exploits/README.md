These scripts are work-in-progress, and are purely for educational use only.

## curler.sh
Simple bash script I used to discover whether there were any useful files accessible over HTTP that did not require authentication to reach.

## login.py
Assuming you have the credentials for the web portal, this script allows you to:
 - Remotely enable
   - uPnP Port Forwarding functionality (also disable)
   - DMZ Host Forwarding for a specific host

## upnp.py
Lists clients currently connected to the router by reading `ajaxQueryDevice.gch` which does not require any authentication. Assuming uPnP is enabled on the router, also allows you to add/remove port forwarding configuration for these hosts.
